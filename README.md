## üß† Introduction

**Git-Guardian** is a secure and adaptive spam moderation tool for GitHub repositories.  
It‚Äôs designed for **open-source maintainers** who want to keep their discussions, issues, and pull requests clean from spam, while maintaining control and flexibility.  
The project is impactful as it empowers maintainers to **automatically moderate**, **fine-tune spam models**, and **ensure token security**, improving collaboration and reducing manual effort.

---

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

- Open-source repos face frequent **spam attacks** in issues, discussions, and pull requests.
- Manual moderation is **time-consuming**, especially for large or popular projects.
- No current solution offers **adaptive learning** based on maintainer feedback.
- Using server-side moderation tools raises **security concerns** due to GitHub token handling.
- Maintainers lack **customizable** tools to define what constitutes spam in their context.

## ‚úÖ Solution Overview


**Git-Guardian** solves the problem with two powerful tools:

1. **GUI Application (CustomTkinter-based)**
   - Runs locally for **maximum security** (tokens stay on the device).
   - Lets users:
     - Select repos and moderation targets (issues, PRs, discussions)
     - Choose actions (delete, hide, close).
     - Tracks Realtime changes to comment status to learn users behavior.
     - Automatically fine-tune the model based on user behavior.
     - Get detailed statistics on spam activity in your repo.
     - Penalize the spammers by blocking them directly from application.
   - Multi-Threaded: Can moderate multiple repositories simultaneously. 
   - Autonomous: once started, Moderation is done autonomously.
   - Multi-Account: Switch between multiple accounts seemlessly.

2. **GitHub Workflow Tool**
   - Lightweight bot to auto-moderate low-activity repos via GitHub Actions
   - Easy to add from **GitHub Marketplace**

**Key Features:**
- üß† AI-based Spam Detection trained on 80K+ messages  
- üîê Local token usage for enhanced security  
- üîÅ Self-improving model through fine-tuning  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Full moderation control for maintainers
